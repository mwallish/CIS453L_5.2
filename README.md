The purpose of me pushing this code is to submit the files for the project I've been working on
since the start of my Interface Design II Lab class.

If you would like to take a look at what my web design is, simply download the files, then run them in a
development environment of your choice. I've utilized the React JavaScript Library to make this program run.
The design is basically what I feel like the Virginia DMV website's "Create Account" page should look like once you click the link for it.
